Stages of lung cancer
=====================

Non-small cell lung cancer
##########################

- Stage 1: Cancer is found in the lung, but it has not spread outside the lung.
- Stage 2: Cancer is found in the lung and nearby lymph nodes.
- Stage 3: Cancer is in the lung and lymph nodes in the middle of the chest.
- Stage 3A: Cancer is found in lymph nodes, but only on the same side of the chest where cancer first started growing.
- Stage 3B: Cancer has spread to lymph nodes on the opposite side of the chest or to lymph nodes above the collarbone.
- Stage 4: Cancer has spread to both lungs, into the area around the lungs, or to distant organs.


Small-cell lung cancer
######################

Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) has two main stages. In the limited stage, cancer is found in only one lung or nearby lymph nodes on the same side of the chest.

Symptoms
========

Early
#####
- lingering or worsening cough
- coughing up phlegm or blood
- chest pain that worsens when you breathe deeply, laugh, or cough
- hoarseness
- shortness of breath
- wheezing
- weakness and fatigue
- loss of appetite and weight loss

Advanced
########
- lymph nodes: lumps, particularly in the neck or collarbone
- bones: bone pain, particularly in the back, ribs, or hips
- brain or spine: headache, dizziness, balance issues, or numbness in arms or legs
- liver: yellowing of skin and eyes (jaundice)

Paraneoplastic syndrome
#######################
muscle weakness
nausea
vomiting
fluid retention
high blood pressure
high blood sugar
confusion
seizures
coma

Risk factors for lung cancer
============================


Treatment
=========

non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
##################################

- Stage 1 NSCLC: Surgery to remove a portion of the lung may be all you need. Chemotherapy may also be recommended, especially if you’re at high risk of recurrence.
- Stage 2 NSCLC: You may need surgery to remove part or all of your lung. Chemotherapy is usually recommended.
- Stage 3 NSCLC: You may require a combination of chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation treatment.
- Stage 4 NSCLC is particularly hard to cure. Options include surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy.

Life expectancy
===============

five-year survival rates for NSCLC by stage
###########################################

- Stage 1: 45 to 49 percent
- Stage 2: 30 to 31 percent
- Stage 3A: 14 percent
- Stage 3B: 5 percent
- Stage 4: 1 percent


Small-cell lung cancer
######################
Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is very aggressive. For limited stage SCLC, the five-year survival rate is 14 percent. Median survival is 16 to 24 months. Median survival for extensive stage SCLC is six to 12 months.
