Types of lung cancer
====================

Non-small cell lung cancer
##########################

- Stage 1: Cancer is found in the lung, but it has not spread outside the lung.
- Stage 2: Cancer is found in the lung and nearby lymph nodes.
- Stage 3: Cancer is in the lung and lymph nodes in the middle of the chest.
- Stage 3A: Cancer is found in lymph nodes, but only on the same side of the chest where cancer first started growing.
- Stage 3B: Cancer has spread to lymph nodes on the opposite side of the chest or to lymph nodes above the collarbone.
- Stage 4: Cancer has spread to both lungs, into the area around the lungs, or to distant organs.

Small-cell lung cancer
######################

Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) has two main stages. In the limited stage, cancer is found in only one lung or nearby lymph nodes on the same side of the chest.


Adenocarcinoma
##############
선암(腺癌); 선(腺)을 구성하고 있는 세포에서 발생하는 암.
이 형의 암은 위 ·장 ·기관지 ·자궁(체부) ·담낭 등의 점막을 비롯하여, 전립선 ·고환 ·난소 ·갑상선 ·이자의 선 조직이나 배설관에서 발생한다. 암 중에서 가장 많이 발생하는 위암의 대부분이 이 형을 나타내지만, 자궁경관암의 대부분은 편평상피암(扁平上皮癌)이고 선암은 드물다. 양성인 선종(腺腫)과 비슷하며 악성을 나타내는 것도 있는데 이것은 특히 악성선종이라 한다. [1]_

Symptoms
========

Early
#####
- lingering or worsening cough
- coughing up phlegm or blood
- chest pain that worsens when you breathe deeply, laugh, or cough
- hoarseness
- shortness of breath
- wheezing
- weakness and fatigue
- loss of appetite and weight loss

Advanced
########
- lymph nodes: lumps, particularly in the neck or collarbone
- bones: bone pain, particularly in the back, ribs, or hips
- brain or spine: headache, dizziness, balance issues, or numbness in arms or legs
- liver: yellowing of skin and eyes (jaundice)

Paraneoplastic syndrome
#######################
muscle weakness
nausea
vomiting
fluid retention
high blood pressure
high blood sugar
confusion
seizures
coma

Treatment
=========

non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
##################################

- Stage 1 NSCLC: Surgery to remove a portion of the lung may be all you need. Chemotherapy may also be recommended, especially if you’re at high risk of recurrence.
- Stage 2 NSCLC: You may need surgery to remove part or all of your lung. Chemotherapy is usually recommended.
- Stage 3 NSCLC: You may require a combination of chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation treatment.
- Stage 4 NSCLC is particularly hard to cure. Options include surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy.

--------

Life expectancy
===============

five-year survival rates for NSCLC by stage
###########################################

- Stage 1: 45 to 49 percent
- Stage 2: 30 to 31 percent
- Stage 3A: 14 percent
- Stage 3B: 5 percent
- Stage 4: 1 percent


Small-cell lung cancer
######################
Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is very aggressive. For limited stage SCLC, the five-year survival rate is 14 percent. Median survival is 16 to 24 months. Median survival for extensive stage SCLC is six to 12 months.
