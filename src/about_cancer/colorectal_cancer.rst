Treating stage IV rectal cancer
###############################
Stage IV rectal cancers have spread to distant organs and tissues such as the liver or lungs. Treatment options for stage IV disease depend to some extent on how widespread the cancer is.

If the cancer is more widespread and canâ€™t be removed completely by surgery, the cancer will likely be treated with chemo and/or targeted therapy drugs (without surgery). Some of the options include:

- FOLFOX: leucovorin, 5-FU, and oxaliplatin (Eloxatin)
- FOLFIRI: leucovorin, 5-FU, and irinotecan (Camptosar)
- CAPEOX or CAPOX: capecitabine (Xeloda) and oxaliplatin
- FOLFOXIRI: leucovorin, 5-FU, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan
- One of the above combinations, plus either a drug that targets VEGF (bevacizumab [Avastin], ziv-aflibercept [Zaltrap], or ramucirumab [Cyramza]), or a drug that targets EGFR (cetuximab [Erbitux] or panitumumab [Vectibix])
- 5-FU and leucovorin, with or without a targeted drug
- Capecitabine, with or without a targeted drug
- Irinotecan, with or without a targeted drug
- Cetuximab alone
- Panitumumab alone
- Regorafenib (Stivarga) alone
- Trifluridine and tipiracil (Lonsurf)

If chemo shrinks the tumors, in some cases it may be possible to consider surgery to try to remove all of the cancer at this point. Chemo may then be given again after surgery.

If the tumor doesn't shrink, a different drug combination may be tried. For people with certain gene changes in their cancer cells, another option after initial chemotherapy might be treatment with an immunotherapy drug such as pembrolizumab (Keytruda).


Treating distant recurrence
###########################

If the cancer has spread too much to be treated with surgery, chemo and/or targeted therapies may be used. Possible regimens are the same as for stage IV disease.

For people whose cancers are found to have certain traits on lab tests, another option might be treatment with immunotherapy.

Your options depend on which, if any, drugs you had before the cancer came back and how long ago you got them, as well as your overall health. You may still need surgery at some point to relieve or prevent blockage of the colon or other local problems. Radiation therapy may be an option to relieve symptoms as well.

Recurrent cancers can often be hard to treat, so you might also want to ask your doctor if clinical trials of newer treatments are available. [1]_
